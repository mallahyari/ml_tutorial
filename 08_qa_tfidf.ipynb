    "## What is TF-IDF?\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF stands for \"Term Frequency — Inverse Document Frequency\". It is a statistical technique that quantifies the importance of a word in a document based on how often it appears in that document and a given collection of documents (corpus). The intuition for this measure is : If a word occurs frequently in a document, then it should be more important and relevant than other words that appear fewer times and we should give that word a high score (TF). But if a word appears many times in a document but also in too many other documents, it’s probably not a relevant and meaningful word, therefore we should assign a lower score to that word (IDF). The relevancy of a word is proportional to the amount of information that it gives about its context (a sentence, a document or a full dataset). The more relevant words help us better understand the entire document without reading it completely. The most relevant words are not necessary the most frequent words since **stopwords** like \"the\", \"of\" or \"a\" tend to occur very often in many documents, but do not give much information. TF-IDF method is widely used in Information Retrieval and Text Mining. The TF-IDF score of term $t$ in document $d$ with respect to corpus $D$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$tfidf(t,d,D)=tf(t,d)\\times idf(d,D)$$"

    "### Term Frequency (TF) Score\n",
    "\n",
    "First we have to calculate the $tf(t,d)$, which is simply the number of times each word $t$ appeared in document $d$. While calculating $tf(t,d)$, we usually remove words like \"a\", \"as\", \"the\". These words are called stopwords and will not provide much information. Additionally, there could be many high frequency non-stopwords that do not provide much information in a given context (e.g., “Disney” in a collection of documents about “Disney\tWorld”), Therefore, we can filter them out too. Also, we normalize the term-frequency to make sure there is no bias for longer or shorter documents. Thus, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$tf(t,d)=\\frac{f_{t,d}}{\\sum_{t'} f_{t',d}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $f_{t,d}$ is the number of occurances of $t$ in $d$."

    "\n",
    "$$idf(t,D)=\\log(\\frac{N}{n_t})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason that we take the $\\log$ of IDF is that if we have a large corpus, the IDF values will become so large, therefore,  we use the $\\log$ value to decrease that effect."

    "\n",
    "In order to understand how to use tf-idf, I am going to make use of this technique in a text searching application. I will use a dataset of [Python questions and answers from Stackoverflow](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/pythonquestions). The dataset contains all the questions (around 700,000) asked between August 2, 2008 and Ocotober 19, 2016. Please see the link for all the details about this dataset. For this application, I only use the Python questions. However, it would be an interesting exercise to create a question-answering application. Each question in this file contains `title` and `body` among other attributes. But I will merely use these two fields from each question in the file."

    "\n",
    "[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch) is an open source distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine. Elasticsearch enables us to index, search, and analyze data at large scale. It provides real-time search and analytics for various types of data including structured or unstructured text, numerical data, or geospatial data. Elasticsearch can efficiently store and index it in a way that supports fast searches. In order to learn Elasticsearch please see the [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/getting-started-install.html). It is out of the scope of this tutorial, so I leave it as an exercise to understand and learn how Elasticsearch works."
