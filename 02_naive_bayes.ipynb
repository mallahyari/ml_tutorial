    "## What is Naive Bayes Method?\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes technique is a supervised method. It is a probabilistic learning method for classifying documents particularly text documents. It works based on the Naive Bayes assumption. Navie Bayes assumes that features $x_1, x_2, \\cdots, x_n$ are **conditionally independent** given the class labels $y$. In other words:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(x_1,x_2,\\cdots,x_n|y)=P(x_1|y)P(x_2|y)\\cdots P(x_n|y)=\\prod_{i=1}^{n}P(x_i|y)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Although often times $x_i$'s are not really conditionally independent in real world, nevertheless, the approach performs surprisingly well in practice, particularly document classification and spam filtering."

    "\n",
    "Let $D$ be a corpus of documents where each document $d$ is represented by a bag of words (i.e. the order of words does not matter), and has a label $y_d$. If the total number of labels are two $y=\\{0,1\\}$, meaning that every document belongs to the class 0 or 1, then the problem is a binary classification. Otherwise it is called a multi-class classification, $y=\\{0,1, \\cdots, k\\}$.\n",
    "For instance, for sentiment analysis we have two classes: \"positive\" and \"negative\", therefore, $y=\\{0,1\\}$, 0 representing \"negative\" class and 1 representing \"positive\" class, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The words of the documents are the features and the total number of features is the size of the vocabulary $|v|$ (i.e. total number of unique words in the corpus). For classifying documents, first we represent each document $d$ as a vector of the words $d=<x_{1}, x_{2},\\cdots,x_{v}>$. Then the probability of document $d$ being in class $y=c$ is:\n",

    "\n",
    "where $N_{ct}$ is the number of occurrences of $t$ (i.e. count or frequency of $t$) in training documents from class $c$, and $\\sum_{t'=1}^v N_{ct'}$ is total count of all the words in documents with label $c$. The parameter $\\alpha \\geq 0$ is called the *smoothing prior*. You can think of it as \"virtual\" or \"imaginary\" counts, which prevents the probabilities from becomming zero when a feature does not exist in the training data. When $\\alpha =1$, it is called *Laplace smoothing*."
